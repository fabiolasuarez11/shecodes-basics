    <h1>Italian Weeding Soup</h1>
    <h2>One of the best soups from Italian cousine</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>This Italian Weeding Soup is a perfect mixture of delicious flavors to enjoy during the fall, winter or even
      summer. My favorite recipe for preparing this flavorful soup is the one from <a
        href="https://natashaskitchen.com/italian-wedding-soup/" target="_blank">Natasha's Kitchen</a>. The recipe is
      not just easy to
      prepare, but has no artificial flavors or processed ingredients, all ingredients are natural and fresh.</p>
    <p>The major source of flavor in this soup are little juicy meatballs seasoned with garlic and parmesan cheese.
      However, the simplicity of this recipe allow you to add your own flavors. I like to add some extra flavor to the
      ground beef and pork for the meatballs with fresh chives, oregano, parsley and sage. I have known also of people
      who use veal instead of pork. I think this recipe is a five stars for its simplicity and delicious flavor that
      remind us that Italian food is
      beyond of time.</p>
